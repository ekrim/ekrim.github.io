        Hi! My name is Evan Kriminger. I am currently a senior data scientist at Zestfinance in Los Angeles and was previously a machine learning researcher at Leap Motion in San Francisco. In Fall 2015, I received my Ph.D from the Computational NeuroEngineering Lab at the University of Florida.

        Some of my current and past research interests are data engineering tools for machine learning, computer vision and object tracking, recurrent networks, state representations for reinforcement learning, constrained clustering, and active learning.
