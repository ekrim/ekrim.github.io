Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def model_fn(x):
  '''x is a placeholder'''
  x = tf.layers.dense(x, 10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)

def train():
  input_tens = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None, 784))
  output_tens = model_fn(input_tens)
 
  y_target = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None, 10))

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
