For the last 7 years I've been working at Apple on the CoreMotion team before recently stepping away to do some traveling and learn new things.

I spent a lot of time writing embedded C++ for low-latency IMU processing. Aside from working with great people and shipping many cool features, my engineering career was shaped by working on the embedded platform, navigating the massive iOS codebase, and the sheer scale of deployment. On my team, I was known for implementing numerical algorithms and tackling deep, meticulous projects. I take pride in writing efficient and collaborator-friendly code.

Prior to Apple I worked on vision, tracking, and generative AI problems, implementing papers and writing training pipelines (some trace of that era is on my Github). My PhD was on unsupervised and active learning, but included some reinforcement and deep learning.

**Seeking opportunities!**

Seeking roles in SF or remote, focused on high-performance C++/numerics, with a preference for AI or vision/tracking problems.
