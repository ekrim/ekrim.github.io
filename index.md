For the last 7 years I've been working at Apple on the CoreMotion team before recently stepping away to do some traveling and learn new things.

I spent a lot of time writing embedded C++ for low-latency IMU processing. Aside from working with great people and building cool devices, the combination of the embedded platform, navigating the massive iOS codebase codebase, and the sheer scale of deployment, really shaped my engineering career. On my team, I was known for implementing numerical algorithms and tackling deep, meticulous projects. I take pride in writing efficient and collaborator-friendly code.

Prior to that I worked on vision, tracking, and generative AI problems, implementing papers and writing training pipelines (some trace of that era is on my Github). My PhD was on unsupervised and active learning, but included some reinforcement and deep learning.
